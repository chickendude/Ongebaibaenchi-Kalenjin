### Grammar

### 3.1 Combining Words

When you’re calling someone to come and do something, the following verb is often combined with *nyon*. Examples:  
**nyon isus** → **nyosus** – come have a bite  
**nyon iru** → **nyoru** – come sleep  
**nyon itien** → **nyotien** – come sing

### 3.2 Past Tense and Impersonal Form

The past tense in Kalenjin is divided into a few different times. We add the prefix *ka-* to show that something happened earlier today, *ko-* to show that it happened yesterday, and *ki-* to show that it happened in the remote past:

| ka- | today's past |
| :---- | :---- |
| ko- | yesterday's past |
| ki- | remote past |

Additionally, we saw in lesson 2 that the infix -ki- or -ke-can be added to make it impersonal, like saying "(some)one has done something". This can also play the role of the passive, as Kalenjin has no special passive form. Here we can see it with the *k* voiced into a *g*: -gi- or -ge-.

Let's look at the verb "sich", *to give birth to*:

* Kasich lakwet – (She) has given birth to a child. (She) gave birth to a child (today).
* Kagesich lakwet – A child was born (today). (lit. *one gave birth to a child*)

In yesterday's past, we use the prefix *ko-*. Let's look at the verb "tyen", *to sing*:

* Kotyen – He/she sang (yesterday).
* Kogetyen – (The song) was sung (yesterday).

In the remote past, we use *ki-*. For example, the verb "nyo(n)", *to come* and "cham", *to like/love*:

* Kinyo – (He/she) came (a long time ago)
* Kicham – He/she loved (a long time ago)

We also saw another example of the ki- -en form: "kiguuren", *his/her name is …* This is from the verb *kuur/guur*, "to call (someone a name)". The ki- makes it impersonal or passive, and the -en tells us that it's done "with" something.  
**Keguuren Kibet.** – He is called by (the name of) Kibet. One calls him with (the name) Kibet.

### 3.3 A Second Look at -e

The suffix -e that we learned in Lesson 1 doesn't correspond exactly to the present tense as we know it in English. It actually marks the "aspect" of the verb, meaning it tells us how the action took place over time. This -e tells us that the action was "durative", meaning that it's ongoing or lasting for a while.  
**kogisiche ngetet** – a boy was being born

So what we would consider a tense in English is split into two parts. We have the tense marker (past, present, future), which comes before the root, and the aspect marker (ongoing or completed), which comes after it. Only the "durative" aspect has a special suffix added.

### 3.4 Mi(ten)

Normally, the verb "to be" is left out. However, when talking about where something is located or its existence, we use the verb *mi* or *miten*. It seems similar to Mandarin's 在/有.  
mi / miten	he/she/they are there  
ami/amiten	I am here/there  
imi / imiten	you are here/there  
kimi / kimiten	we are here/there

### 3.5 Ilenjin

The name *Kalenjin* comes from this word, which literally means "I have told you". In the dialog, we saw the form "ilenjin", which means "tell him/her". Note here that the "-chin(i)" merges in with the root, and we get "ilenjin" instead of "ilenjchin".

Ilenjin / Mwochin konyo	You tell him / her to come (command)  
Ilenjon / Mwowon anyo 	You tell me to come  
Mwowech kebwan	You tell us to come  
Ilenjin / Mwochin kobwa	Tell them to come
