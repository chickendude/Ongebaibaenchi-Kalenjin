### Grammar

#### itu / ite - Directional suffixes

You can add -u to the verb to give the meaning of movement towards the speaker, e.g. come here.  
ibu - ibe (take here / take away)  
sutu - sute (bring here / take away)  
ketu - kete (drive here / drive there)

#### \*\*moribe sait – what is moribe? Is the root "rib" / keep?

Mo is the negative form. So when we say moribe means *he/she doesn't keep*.

#### Tomo

Tomo is a word meaning *not yet*.  
Tomo iwe gaa? – You aren't going home yet?  
Tomo konyo Michael Kenya. – Michael hasn't come to Kenya yet.  
Tomo kobagach Lucas maiwek. – Lucas hasn't quit beer yet.

#### Oini – Is this specific to "me"? Or can you say "oini inye" "oini echek"

Oini means "here (I am)" , like *voici* in French.  
Oini anee. – Here I am.  
Onchu echek. – Here we are.  
Onchuun ichek. – Here they are.

#### kakanyan - is this the today past tense, "you have waited for me"? "You wait for me" is "ikanyan", so how does that join with the past tense?

"You wait for me" - Kanyan we drop "i" for the second person. Kakanyan is what happened a few minutes ago. Interestingly, if it were yesterday we would say *kookanyan*.

#### "Koipir lagok ak ityar" is "ityar" also in the past because "ko ipir" is in the past? Could we get some examples of more "double past" sentences?

The tense of the first verb determines the tense of the ones that follow. If you want to use a different tense with the second verb, you should clarify with time markers.  
*Koipir ak koityar* is correct but wouldn't sound as nice when talking.  
*Koipir amut ak ityar rani* will clarify the tenses. If it's not explained, however, it will mean the action happened in the same tense as the first verb.  
**Koikwany ak iam.** – You cooked (ugali) and ate.  
**Koinyebut ak ing'ung'u.** – You drank (beer) and vomited.  
**Koiru ak isokos.** – You slept and peed.

#### "Ee, ko nerekek." Is this a verb "konerekek"? Is "ko" the same thing marks the past tense in verbs?

Ko marks the past. Konerekek. In Kalenjin it works the same if ko is separated from the main verb or joined

#### Nyolu – Must

This word means "must" and is followed by a verb indicating who "must" do the action.  
**Nyolu ikwany.** – You must cook (ugali).  
**Nyolu okwany.** – You all must cook (ugali).

#### "lagokuk" – Is this "lagok \+ (che)kwok" for "your"?

Lagok (che) kuk - your children (as one person).  
Lagok (che) kwok - your children (more than one person

#### Kiruogindet

Kiruogindet is anyone who is listening to a case. In Kenya there's a person employed by the government we call then chiefs who have power to arrest and judge on Minor village issues and that is why Kalenjin call kiruogindet.
