### Grammar

### 7.1 Sentence Structure

You can say **Chang' boisionik che otinye** or **Otinye boisionik che chang'** (*I have a lot of work*). You can't say *Otinye chang' boisionik*, though, as that is not grammatically correct in Kalenjin. The first sentence is literally "Much \[is\] the work which I have." The second is "I have much work."

Here are some more examples:  
Otinye tuga che chang.	I have many cows.  
Chang tuga che otinye.	The cows I have are many.

Otinye bendo ne o.		I have a big (piece of) meat.
