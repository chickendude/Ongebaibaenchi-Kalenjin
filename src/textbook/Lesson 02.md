### Grammar

### 2.1 Che vs Ne

These correspond to English "who" and "which" in phrases like "the man who is tall" or "the houses which are big". *Che* is used for plural nouns, and *ne* is used for singular nouns.

For example:

* **Bandek che tolelion** – yellow maize (multiple), multiple pieces of corn which are yellow
* **Bandiat ne tolelion** – yellow maize (one), one piece of corn which is yellow

Note how the words *maiwek* and *bandek* in the lesson for *beer* and *maize* respectively are actually plural forms in Kalenjin, whereas we would be more likely to use singular or collective forms in English. Thus "*Maiwek \[...\] che kichoben bandek*", translates to "Beer which is made from maize" but literally means "Beers which are made from corns".

### 2.2 More on Verbs (Indirect Objects)

As we mentioned before, Kalenjin verbs contain more information than English verbs. In this lesson's dialog, we came across some new verb forms containing information on who is receiving the action in addition to who is performing it. Note that the tones may change for these depending on who the subject is, but we're still investigating how the tone system works.

| to me | -on |
| ----: | :---- |
| to you | -in |
| to him/her | -chin(i) |
| to us | -ech |
| to you all | -ok |
| to them | -chin(i) |

Let's look at the verb "kon" / "gon", *to give*. If you want to give something *to* somebody, you'll need to use the object markers above. **Note that we still have some uncertainty on the full verb system.**  
I

| ogonin / agonin | I give to you |
| :---- | :---- |
| ogochini / agochini | I give to him / her |
| ogonok / agonok | I give to you all |
| ogochini / agochini | I give to them |

You (singular)

| igonon | You give to me |
| :---- | :---- |
| igochin | You give to him |
| konech \* / gonech \* | You give to us |
| igochin | You give to them |

\* Note that the "i" is missing in this form, the only difference between *you give us* (konech) and *he/she gives us* (konech) is the tone: konēch (you give us) vs. kōnēch (he gives us). Also note that the "i-" is often dropped here when used as the first verb ("You give me water" vs. "You want to give me water").

He/She

| konon / gonon | He gives to me |
| :---- | :---- |
| konin / gonin | She gives to you |
| kochin / igochin | He gives to him |
| konech \* / gonech \* | She gives to us |
| konok / gonok | He gives to you all |
| kochin / igochin \* | She gives to them |

\* See note above for "You (singular)"

We

| kigonin | We give to you |
| :---- | :---- |
| kigochin | We give to him |
| kigonok | We give to you all |
| kigochin | We give to them |

You (plural)

| ogonon | You give to me |
| :---- | :---- |
| ogochini | You give to him / her |
| ogonech | You give us |
| ogochini | You give to them |

They

| konon / gonon | They give to me |
| :---- | :---- |
| konin / gonin | They give to you |
| kochini / gochini (??) | They give to him |
| konech \* / gonech \* | They give to us |
| konok / gonok | They give to you all |
| kochini / gochini (??) | They give to them |

I tell  
omwochi – I tell him / her  
komwoun – I tell you  
mwowon – tell me

### 2.3 ki- and -en

*-en* can be added after the verb root to say what was used, it can often be translated by the word "with".

ki- or ke- can be added before the verb root to turn it into a sort of passive verb.  
-choben	to make/produce with  
kichob-		made  
kichoben	made with

*Kichoben mosongik busaa.*	*Busaa* is made from sorghum.

### 2.4 ko

This little word is used to bring the topic to the start of the sentence, similar to saying "as for …" in English. So in *Busaa ko nee?*, it's literally like "As for *busaa*, what (is it)?". It is fairly common when asking what something is, but it can also be used in other situations, e.g.:  
Nyone bomori komwoun.	Grandpa is coming to tell you.  
Bomori ko nyone komwoun.	As for Grandpa, he's coming to tell you.

Omoche mursik.	I want sour milk  
Mursik ko omoche.	As for sour milk, I want it.

### 2.5 Chebo vs Nebo

There's a similar contrast as *che* / *ne*, where singular subjects go with *ne* and plural ones are followed by *che*.

Ketik *chebo* bomori	trees *that belong to* grandfather  
Ketit *nebo* bomori	a tree *that belongs to* grandfather

Bik *chebo* Kenya	people *of* Kenya, Kenyan people  
Chito nebo Kenya	a person of Kenya, a Kenyan person

Maiwek *chebo keny* en Kenya	Beer *belonging to ancient times* in Kenya  
A traditional Kenyan beer  
Note again that "maiwek" is considered plural in Kalenjin\!
