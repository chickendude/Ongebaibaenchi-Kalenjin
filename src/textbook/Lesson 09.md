### Grammar

#### -ji

Kakoluulji - "ji" here stands for "to".  
Kakoluulji karit bereisit. – The car has fallen to a ditch.  
If we say *kakoluul kariit*, it means *the car has got an accident* (literally *the car has fallen*)

#### ako

**Ako** is the same as **ak**. The "o" is just added to make it flow a bit better.

#### let's

ngebe – let's go (you and me)  
ngepir – let's beat (you and me)  
ongeyom – let's try (all of us)  
Note: when we're talking to just one person, we use 'ng'. If "let's" refers to two or more people (in addition to yourself), we start with 'o'.

#### anan vs. anan ko

Somok anan ko angwan. – Three or four.  
If we only say *Somok anan angwan?* it'll be perceived as a question, rather than a statement. Adding "ko" confirms that it's the answer to a question.

* Lakwet ne ng'om en kilas ko ng'etet **anan** chepto? – Is the smartest child in the class a boy or a girl?
* Chepto **anan ko** ng'etet ne kaam kimnyet tugul. – A girl or boy ate all the ugali.
* Imi kilas **anan** tuiyet? – Are you in class or in a meeting?
* Werinyun motinye kasarta, mi kilas **anan ko** mi tuiyet. – My son is busy, he's in class or a meeting. \[not has / time\]
* Iman **anan** lembech? – (Is it) truth or a lie?
* Iman **anan ko** lembech. – A truth or a lie.
* Suse **anan** nyee? – Is he biting or chewing?
* Suse **anan** **ko** nyee. – He is biting or chewing.

#### Torta vs Torten

Amoche atorta karit. – I want to push the car.  
Torten karit kwo legem. – Push the car to the valley.  
Torten is somehow a command.  
There are some changes in the verbs  
Atortai – I am pushing   
Tortai – They/she/he is/are pushing.  
Torten – (you) push

#### (i)chut

It's pronounced with a high tone when it means to get in and a high falling tone when it means to pull. Additionally, the third-person forms optionally include "i", similar to the second-person singular forms, and only tone distinguishes between them.  
(Note: Depending on tone, these could also mean "get in")  
achute – I pull  
ichute – you pull  
(i)chute – he/she/it pulls  
kichute – we pull  
ochute – you all pull  
(i)chute – they pull

#### ke- vs kai- vs kaai-

There is a difference, it's not exactly clear to us what it is, perhaps the distance in the past?  
Keng'alech - you cheated us  
Kaing'alech - you have already cheated us (just some time now, not more than some hours)  
Keker Michael kayae nee. – You saw Michael doing what?  
Kaiker Michael, yae nee. – You have seen Michael, what is he doing?  
— \[questions\]   
Kakeer (he saw) vs kaakeer (he has seen) vs kaakokeer (he has seen)  
→ Chito ne kakeer vs Chito ne kaakeer? (can you say both)

#### Isten

isten – remove  
keisten – we remove   
Isten rotwet en yon miten lagok. – Remove the knife from there (where) children are.  
Isten karit en oret – Remove the vehicle from the road.

#### kaomwaa

Kaamwaa - I have said (a- anee)  
Kaimwaa - you have said (i - inyee)
