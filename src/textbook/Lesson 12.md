| Chelangat | Ee kakwo. Kariren missing. Imache konam inendet ting'oek i? Mabaibai en tuguk che keyai. | Yes, I pity for him a lot. Do you want him to catch a cold? I am not happy with what you've done. |

| Kwondo | Iberber. Itie konut kityo. Kayai che yachen ak imoche ayat kot i? Komi kotab chepkinyariat koyae nee? Mamoche aguiyo ngolyot non. | You're foolish. You're supporting your father only. He did bad and you want me to open the house? He was in the prostitute's house doing what? I don't want to understand that word. |
| Chelangat | Kakoasasta ropta, makitinye busiek kakorobonji. Kikwanye nee nguni chebo langat? Ame nee lagok chu mengech? | The rain has subsided, we don't have flour, it has been rained on. What shall we cook now for evening? What will these young children eat? |
