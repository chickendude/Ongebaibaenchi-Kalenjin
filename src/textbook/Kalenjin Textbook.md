## Grammar

### 1.1 Verb Conjugations in Kalenjin

Verbs in Kalenjin hold a lot more information than in English. We'll gradually cover how they work, for now let's look at how to form simple, present tense forms.

These are the personal prefixes for verbs, telling us who the subject of the verb is:

| I | o-/a- |
| :---- | :---- |
| you (sg) | i- |
| he/she/it | - / ko- |
| we | ki- |
| you (pl) | o- |
| they | - / ko- |

Some examples:  
I am hungry. – Osiorore/Asiorore.  
We are hungry. – Kisiorore/Kisiorortosi.  
They are hungry – Siorortos.  
Are you hungry? – Tos isiorore?

### 1.2 Present Tense (Imperfect Aspect)

The present tense is formed by adding the personal prefix at the front of the root and the tense suffix -i or -e at the end.

Take a look at the verb **chom** / **cham**, *to like* (see note at end regarding a/o):

1. achome mursik – I like sour milk  
2. ichome mursik – you like sour milk  
3. chome mursik – he/she likes sour milk  
4. kichome mursik – we like sour milk  
5. ochome mursik – you all like sour milk  
6. chome mursik – they like sour milk

### 1.3 Multiple Verbs

Note that when multiple verbs are stringed together, the personal prefix is added, but the tense suffix (-e / -i) is not.

For example, look at how the following verbs change when they come after **moch** / **mach**, *to want.* Also pay attention to the 3rd person forms, which use the prefix "ko-".  
**am** (eat)

1. omoche aam kimyet – I want to eat ugali  
2. imoche iam kimyet – you want to eat ugali  
3. moche koam kimyet – he/she wants to eat ugali  
4. kimoche keam kimyet – we want to eat ugali  
5. omoche oam kimyet – you all want to eat ugali  
6. moche koam kimyet – they want to eat ugali

Note: **kiame** means *we are eating*, but can also mean *it's edible*, depending on the context.

**tar** (finish)

1. omoche atar bendo – I want to finish the meat  
2. imoche itar bendo – you (singular) want to finish the meat  
3. moche kotar bendo – he/she wants to finish the meat  
4. kimoche ketar bendo – we want to finish the meat  
5. omoche otar bendo – you all want to finish the meat  
6. moche kotar bendo –they want to finish the meat

**inam** (start)

1. omoche anam aam – I want to start to eat  
2. imoche inam iam – you want to start to eat  
3. moche konam koam – he/she want to start to eat  
4. kimoche kinam keam – we want to start to eat  
5. omoche onam oam – you all want to start to eat  
6. moche konam koam – they want to start to eat

**chamcham** (taste)

1. omoche achamcham – I want to taste  
2. imoche ichamcham – you want to taste  
3. moche kochamcham – he/she wants to taste  
4. kimoche kechamcham – we want to taste  
5. omoche ochamcham – you all want to taste  
6. moche kochamcham – they want to taste

### 1.4 "Tos" Questions

Tos is used to mark a question. In the absence of another question word (such as *nee*, "what"), it turns the question into a yes/no question:

1. Tos imoche chego? – Do you want milk?  
2. Tos korur kimyet i? – Is the ugali ready?  
3. Tos iame isagek i? – Do you eat spider plant?

### 1.5 Inamen / inam

Words ending with -en are a sort of guidance as to what you should do, almost like a command, as you’re instructed how to do something.

1. inam – to start/begin  
   inamen – start with/begin with  
   1. *inamen chego* "start with milk"  
2. kwany – to cook (mostly used in ugali).  
   kwanyen/kwangen – cook with/using  
   1. *kwanyen/kwangen* *chepungut* "cook using a clay pot"  
3. tar – to finish  
   taren – finish with/finish using  
   1. *taren ingwek* "finish by eating ('*using'*) the vegetables"  
4. taach – to welcome  
   taachen/taagen- welcome with/welcome using  
   1. *taachen/taagen kimyet* "welcome with the ugali", "help yourself to the ugali"

### 1.6 a vs. o

In Kalenjin, "a" and "o" are often interchangeable. The pronunciation is the same for most words which start with "a" or "o".  
Kipsigis is the Kalenjin dialect spoken by most Kalenjin tribes, and in this dialect (which the course is based off of) you often hear them used interchangeably.

*achame* or *ochome*	I like it or I love it  
*akwanye* or *okwonye*	I am cooking  
*arire* or *orire*	I am crying  
*achamchami* or *ochomchomi*	I am tasting  
*asiorore* or *osiorore*	I am hungry

Whether you use "a" or "o" in these words, the meaning remains the same. The form with “a” is used by all Kalenjin tribes, but the “o” is only used in the Kipsigis dialect. Notice that other "a" sounds generally switch to an "o" as well, not just the initial letter.

## Cultural Note

In Kalenjin, *onyiny* means "sweet" or "delicious" whereas *mindilil* means "sour" or "bitter". When eating in Kalenjin and you’re asked about the food, you should explain how the food tastes, like *mursik* ("sour milk") in the dialog. It is delicious, but you have to also mention what makes it delicious. That's why we add the word *mindilil*, meaning "sour". The sourness is what makes it delicious.

## 

## Grammar

### 2.1 Che vs Ne

These correspond to English "who" and "which" in phrases like "the man who is tall" or "the houses which are big". *Che* is used for plural nouns, and *ne* is used for singular nouns.

For example:

* **Bandek che tolelion** – yellow maize (multiple), multiple pieces of corn which are yellow  
* **Bandiat ne tolelion** – yellow maize (one), one piece of corn which is yellow

Note how the words *maiwek* and *bandek* in the lesson for *beer* and *maize* respectively are actually plural forms in Kalenjin, whereas we would be more likely to use singular or collective forms in English. Thus "*Maiwek \[...\] che kichoben bandek*", translates to "Beer which is made from maize" but literally means "Beers which are made from corns".

### 2.2 More on Verbs (Indirect Objects)

As we mentioned before, Kalenjin verbs contain more information than English verbs. In this lesson's dialog, we came across some new verb forms containing information on who is receiving the action in addition to who is performing it. Note that the tones may change for these depending on who the subject is, but we're still investigating how the tone system works.

| to me | -on |
| ----: | :---- |
| to you | -in |
| to him/her | -chin(i) |
| to us | -ech |
| to you all | -ok |
| to them | -chin(i) |

Let's look at the verb "kon" / "gon", *to give*. If you want to give something *to* somebody, you'll need to use the object markers above. **Note that we still have some uncertainty on the full verb system.**  
I

| ogonin / agonin | I give to you |
| :---- | :---- |
| ogochini / agochini | I give to him / her |
| ogonok / agonok | I give to you all |
| ogochini / agochini | I give to them |

You (singular)

| igonon | You give to me |
| :---- | :---- |
| igochin | You give to him |
| konech \* / gonech \* | You give to us |
| igochin | You give to them |

\* Note that the "i" is missing in this form, the only difference between *you give us* (konech) and *he/she gives us* (konech) is the tone: konēch (you give us) vs. kōnēch (he gives us). Also note that the "i-" is often dropped here when used as the first verb ("You give me water" vs. "You want to give me water").

He/She

| konon / gonon | He gives to me |
| :---- | :---- |
| konin / gonin | She gives to you |
| kochin / igochin | He gives to him |
| konech \* / gonech \* | She gives to us |
| konok / gonok | He gives to you all |
| kochin / igochin \* | She gives to them |

\* See note above for "You (singular)"

We

| kigonin | We give to you |
| :---- | :---- |
| kigochin | We give to him |
| kigonok | We give to you all |
| kigochin | We give to them |

You (plural)

| ogonon | You give to me |
| :---- | :---- |
| ogochini | You give to him / her |
| ogonech | You give us |
| ogochini | You give to them |

They

| konon / gonon | They give to me |
| :---- | :---- |
| konin / gonin | They give to you |
| kochini / gochini (??) | They give to him |
| konech \* / gonech \* | They give to us |
| konok / gonok | They give to you all |
| kochini / gochini (??) | They give to them |

I tell  
omwochi – I tell him / her  
komwoun – I tell you  
mwowon – tell me

### 2.3 ki- and -en

*-en* can be added after the verb root to say what was used, it can often be translated by the word "with".

ki- or ke- can be added before the verb root to turn it into a sort of passive verb.  
-choben	to make/produce with  
kichob-		made  
kichoben	made with

*Kichoben mosongik busaa.*	*Busaa* is made from sorghum.

### 2.4 ko

This little word is used to bring the topic to the start of the sentence, similar to saying "as for …" in English. So in *Busaa ko nee?*, it's literally like "As for *busaa*, what (is it)?". It is fairly common when asking what something is, but it can also be used in other situations, e.g.:  
Nyone bomori komwoun.	Grandpa is coming to tell you.  
Bomori ko nyone komwoun.	As for Grandpa, he's coming to tell you.

Omoche mursik.	I want sour milk  
Mursik ko omoche.	As for sour milk, I want it.

### 2.5 Chebo vs Nebo

There's a similar contrast as *che* / *ne*, where singular subjects go with *ne* and plural ones are followed by *che*.

Ketik *chebo* bomori	trees *that belong to* grandfather  
Ketit *nebo* bomori	a tree *that belongs to* grandfather

Bik *chebo* Kenya	people *of* Kenya, Kenyan people  
Chito nebo Kenya	a person of Kenya, a Kenyan person

Maiwek *chebo keny* en Kenya	Beer *belonging to ancient times* in Kenya  
	A traditional Kenyan beer  
Note again that "maiwek" is considered plural in Kalenjin\!

18. **amunee** - why, lit. "because what?"

## Grammar

### 3.1 Combining Words

When you’re calling someone to come and do something, the following verb is often combined with *nyon*. Examples:  
**nyon isus** → **nyosus** – come have a bite  
**nyon iru** → **nyoru** – come sleep  
**nyon itien** → **nyotien** – come sing

### 3.2 Past Tense and Impersonal Form

The past tense in Kalenjin is divided into a few different times. We add the prefix *ka-* to show that something happened earlier today, *ko-* to show that it happened yesterday, and *ki-* to show that it happened in the remote past:

| ka- | today's past |
| :---- | :---- |
| ko- | yesterday's past |
| ki- | remote past |

Additionally, we saw in lesson 2 that the infix -ki- or -ke-can be added to make it impersonal, like saying "(some)one has done something". This can also play the role of the passive, as Kalenjin has no special passive form. Here we can see it with the *k* voiced into a *g*: -gi- or -ge-.

Let's look at the verb "sich", *to give birth to*:

* Kasich lakwet – (She) has given birth to a child. (She) gave birth to a child (today).  
* Kagesich lakwet – A child was born (today). (lit. *one gave birth to a child*)

In yesterday's past, we use the prefix *ko-*. Let's look at the verb "tyen", *to sing*:

* Kotyen – He/she sang (yesterday).  
* Kogetyen – (The song) was sung (yesterday).

In the remote past, we use *ki-*. For example, the verb "nyo(n)", *to come* and "cham", *to like/love*:

* Kinyo – (He/she) came (a long time ago)  
* Kicham – He/she loved (a long time ago)

We also saw another example of the ki- -en form: "kiguuren", *his/her name is …* This is from the verb *kuur/guur*, "to call (someone a name)". The ki- makes it impersonal or passive, and the -en tells us that it's done "with" something.  
**Keguuren Kibet.** – He is called by (the name of) Kibet. One calls him with (the name) Kibet.

### 3.3 A Second Look at -e

The suffix -e that we learned in Lesson 1 doesn't correspond exactly to the present tense as we know it in English. It actually marks the "aspect" of the verb, meaning it tells us how the action took place over time. This -e tells us that the action was "durative", meaning that it's ongoing or lasting for a while.  
**kogisiche ngetet** – a boy was being born

So what we would consider a tense in English is split into two parts. We have the tense marker (past, present, future), which comes before the root, and the aspect marker (ongoing or completed), which comes after it. Only the "durative" aspect has a special suffix added.

### 3.4 Mi(ten)

Normally, the verb "to be" is left out. However, when talking about where something is located or its existence, we use the verb *mi* or *miten*. It seems similar to Mandarin's 在/有.  
mi / miten	he/she/they are there  
ami/amiten	I am here/there  
imi / imiten	you are here/there  
kimi / kimiten	we are here/there

### 3.5 Ilenjin

The name *Kalenjin* comes from this word, which literally means "I have told you". In the dialog, we saw the form "ilenjin", which means "tell him/her". Note here that the "-chin(i)" merges in with the root, and we get "ilenjin" instead of "ilenjchin".

Ilenjin / Mwochin konyo	You tell him / her to come (command)  
Ilenjon / Mwowon anyo 	You tell me to come  
Mwowech kebwan	You tell us to come  
Ilenjin / Mwochin kobwa	Tell them to come

We can also simply say keer, but adding the -o makes it more of a stronger command.  
ogeero – For multiple people, we add o- to the front.

### 5.3 -(r)o

Kirosigu - "ki" shows the past tense. We can say Kiosigu. "ro" and "o" shows its one person who is talking about himself. Some words can add the "r", some can't.  
- I am saved (kirosigu/Kiosigu)  
- You are saved (kirisigu)  
- You are saved (plural form) kirosigu/Kiosigu. Nb(pronunciation differs from the first person)  
- sigun – repent

*Banda nebo tulwet ko boton*  
Banda - journey  
Boton - I will be among, I am among  
I will/am among those who will be going to the mountain  
Maybe there are 5 people going, and I am one of those 5 people going on that journey.

Examples:

## Grammar

### itu / ite - Directional suffixes

You can add -u to the verb to give the meaning of movement towards the speaker, e.g. come here.  
ibu - ibe (take here / take away)  
sutu - sute (bring here / take away)  
ketu - kete (drive here / drive there)

### \*\*moribe sait – what is moribe? Is the root "rib" / keep?

Mo is the negative form. So when we say moribe means *he/she doesn't keep*.

### Tomo

Tomo is a word meaning *not yet*.  
Tomo iwe gaa? – You aren't going home yet?  
Tomo konyo Michael Kenya. – Michael hasn't come to Kenya yet.  
Tomo kobagach Lucas maiwek. – Lucas hasn't quit beer yet.

### Oini – Is this specific to "me"? Or can you say "oini inye" "oini echek"

Oini means "here (I am)" , like *voici* in French.  
Oini anee. – Here I am.  
Onchu echek. – Here we are.  
Onchuun ichek. – Here they are.

### kakanyan - is this the today past tense, "you have waited for me"? "You wait for me" is "ikanyan", so how does that join with the past tense?

"You wait for me" - Kanyan we drop "i" for the second person. Kakanyan is what happened a few minutes ago. Interestingly, if it were yesterday we would say *kookanyan*.

### "Koipir lagok ak ityar" is "ityar" also in the past because "ko ipir" is in the past? Could we get some examples of more "double past" sentences?

The tense of the first verb determines the tense of the ones that follow. If you want to use a different tense with the second verb, you should clarify with time markers.  
*Koipir ak koityar* is correct but wouldn't sound as nice when talking.  
*Koipir amut ak ityar rani* will clarify the tenses. If it's not explained, however, it will mean the action happened in the same tense as the first verb.  
**Koikwany ak iam.** – You cooked (ugali) and ate.  
**Koinyebut ak ing'ung'u.** – You drank (beer) and vomited.  
**Koiru ak isokos.** – You slept and peed.

### "Ee, ko nerekek." Is this a verb "konerekek"? Is "ko" the same thing marks the past tense in verbs?

Ko marks the past. Konerekek. In Kalenjin it works the same if ko is separated from the main verb or joined

### Nyolu – Must

This word means "must" and is followed by a verb indicating who "must" do the action.  
**Nyolu ikwany.** – You must cook (ugali).  
**Nyolu okwany.** – You all must cook (ugali).

### "lagokuk" – Is this "lagok \+ (che)kwok" for "your"?

Lagok (che) kuk - your children (as one person).  
Lagok (che) kwok - your children (more than one person

### Kiruogindet

Kiruogindet is anyone who is listening to a case. In Kenya there's a person employed by the government we call then chiefs who have power to arrest and judge on Minor village issues and that is why Kalenjin call kiruogindet.

### 7.1 Sentence Structure

You can say **Chang' boisionik che otinye** or **Otinye boisionik che chang'** (*I have a lot of work*). You can't say *Otinye chang' boisionik*, though, as that is not grammatically correct in Kalenjin. The first sentence is literally "Much \[is\] the work which I have." The second is "I have much work."

Here are some more examples:  
Otinye tuga che chang.	I have many cows.  
Chang tuga che otinye.	The cows I have are many.

Otinye bendo ne o.		I have a big (piece of) meat.  
O bendo ne otinye.		The meat I have is big.

The verb **bol** can mean to shout or just be noisy in general.

Bole Chemoget missing.	The boss is shouting. / The boss is making a lot of noise.

## Grammar

### -ji

Kakoluulji - "ji" here stands for "to".  
Kakoluulji karit bereisit. – The car has fallen to a ditch.  
If we say *kakoluul kariit*, it means *the car has got an accident* (literally *the car has fallen*)

### ako

**Ako** is the same as **ak**. The "o" is just added to make it flow a bit better.

### let's

ngebe – let's go (you and me)  
ngepir – let's beat (you and me)  
ongeyom – let's try (all of us)  
Note: when we're talking to just one person, we use 'ng'. If "let's" refers to two or more people (in addition to yourself), we start with 'o'.

### anan vs. anan ko

Somok anan ko angwan. – Three or four.  
If we only say *Somok anan angwan?* it'll be perceived as a question, rather than a statement. Adding "ko" confirms that it's the answer to a question.

* Lakwet ne ng'om en kilas ko ng'etet **anan** chepto? – Is the smartest child in the class a boy or a girl?  
* Chepto **anan ko** ng'etet ne kaam kimnyet tugul. – A girl or boy ate all the ugali.  
* Imi kilas **anan** tuiyet? – Are you in class or in a meeting?  
* Werinyun motinye kasarta, mi kilas **anan ko** mi tuiyet. – My son is busy, he's in class or a meeting. \[not has / time\]  
* Iman **anan** lembech? – (Is it) truth or a lie?  
* Iman **anan ko** lembech. – A truth or a lie.  
* Suse **anan** nyee? – Is he biting or chewing?  
* Suse **anan** **ko** nyee. – He is biting or chewing.

### Torta vs Torten

Amoche atorta karit. – I want to push the car.  
Torten karit kwo legem. – Push the car to the valley.  
Torten is somehow a command.  
There are some changes in the verbs  
Atortai – I am pushing   
Tortai – They/she/he is/are pushing.  
Torten – (you) push

### (i)chut

It's pronounced with a high tone when it means to get in and a high falling tone when it means to pull. Additionally, the third-person forms optionally include "i", similar to the second-person singular forms, and only tone distinguishes between them.  
(Note: Depending on tone, these could also mean "get in")  
achute – I pull  
ichute – you pull  
(i)chute – he/she/it pulls  
kichute – we pull  
ochute – you all pull  
(i)chute – they pull

### ke- vs kai- vs kaai-

There is a difference, it's not exactly clear to us what it is, perhaps the distance in the past?  
Keng'alech - you cheated us  
Kaing'alech - you have already cheated us (just some time now, not more than some hours)  
Keker Michael kayae nee. – You saw Michael doing what?  
Kaiker Michael, yae nee. – You have seen Michael, what is he doing?  
— \[questions\]   
Kakeer (he saw) vs kaakeer (he has seen) vs kaakokeer (he has seen)  
 → Chito ne kakeer vs Chito ne kaakeer? (can you say both) 

### Isten

isten – remove  
keisten – we remove   
Isten rotwet en yon miten lagok. – Remove the knife from there (where) children are.  
Isten karit en oret – Remove the vehicle from the road.

### kaomwaa

Kaomwaa - 'o' many people   
Kaamwaa - I have said (a- anee)  
Kaimwaa - you have said (i - inyee)  
Kaomwaa - you have said (o - okwek)
