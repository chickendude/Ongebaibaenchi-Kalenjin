* ko-i-oldo-i – you just sold.  
  ko- at the beginning mostly shows time the action happened and “i” at the end shows it is a direct speech. We'd say kooldoo / koaldoo if it was a reported speech.
    * what would kooldoo/koaldoo mean?

Koioldoi - I am speaking to you directly. Michael koioldoi teta amut.  
But if I am telling you about Lucas I will say  
Koaldoo Lucas teta - Lucas sold the cow  
I in the middle comes from the word Inyee to mean you, and i at the end is emphasis to the person being spoken to. Remember the pronoun INYENDET

Kigomwoun - from the word gomwoun/komwoun which means I tell you. it's one word, the changes are the first syllables ki and end un.

Kigomwoun - I told you (singular)  
Kigomwowok - I told you (plural)
