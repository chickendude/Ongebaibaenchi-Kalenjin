## Kalenjin Textbook

These dialogs are intended to be the foundation for a Kalenjin textbook. The current WIP version of the textbook can be
found in the side bar.

You can also check out the original Google Doc:  
[Kalenjin Textbook - Original](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DTPlL7x21X5R_raGRyIcjS3zKrYsrG74M11pMinHv1Q/edit?usp=sharing)

The textbook contains some grammar notes and explanations, though the later lessons have fewer explanations, largely
because i haven't really needed them as much.

## Class Notes

There is a second tab in the document above containing "Class Notes". What these are is basically a massive set of
sentences (currently over a thousand) in Kalenjin with English translations and occasionally word for word literal 
translations when a sentence wasn't clear to me.
