### Grammar

### 5.1 ko

Nyon ko - Come inside  
Ko (kot) house - we say *ko* to mean inside. Kot/Got is the name of the house but to mean inside we say "ko"  
konyun – into my house

### 5.2 keero

We can also simply say keer, but adding the -o makes it more of a stronger command.  
ogeero – For multiple people, we add o- to the front.

### 5.3 -(r)o

Kirosigu - "ki" shows the past tense. We can say Kiosigu. "ro" and "o" shows its one person who is talking about himself. Some words can add the "r", some can't.
- I am saved (kirosigu/Kiosigu)
- You are saved (kirisigu)
- You are saved (plural form) kirosigu/Kiosigu. Nb(pronunciation differs from the first person)
- sigun – repent

### 5.4 Boton

The -n here is the "n" from "anee", signifying "me".

*Banda nebo tulwet ko boton*  
Banda - journey  
Boton - I will be among, I am among  
I will/am among those who will be going to the mountain  
Maybe there are 5 people going, and I am one of those 5 people going on that journey.

Examples:  
**Boto Michael ne inetegee Kalenjin**  
Michael is among those who are learning Kalenjin

**Boto inendet ne iyogi tuga**  
He/she among those who are herding cattle

**Botech che ibe konunotiot**  
We will be among those who will be taking the present

**Boten ne rue?**  
Are you (sg) among those who are sleeping?

**Botok che rue?**  
Are you (pl) among those who are sleeping?

### 5.5 -nyun

When it ends in a consonant, we generally use nenyun instead of the short -nyun form:  
kwondanyun (my wife) vs kwariat nenyun (my ankle)
